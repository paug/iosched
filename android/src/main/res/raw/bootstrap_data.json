Most libs now rely on annotation processing during build to pre-compute a lot of stuff that will boost them at runtime. Let’s think about Dagger, ButerKnife, Hugo, RoboGuice, BoundBox, Memento, IcePick etc.\n\nNevertheless, writing an annotation processor is far from obvious as it offers an API that is very difficult to understand. The main idea of this session is to suggest an alternative technology (or a complement in some cases): post-compilation processing and byte code manipulation.\n\nThis session is an in-depth review of byte code manipulation in Java and its limitations on Android. Stéphane will also explore a few techniques and librairies that make it simple to write a post compiler byte code processor, with gradle and maven examples. He will be presenting two librairies during his session: AfterBurner and Mimic.\n\nSee how to eliminate all boiler plate from your favorite librairies and boost your applications.",

With its unique features, like closures, builders, code transformations, traits, static compilation and many others, Groovy has become a very competitive language on the JVM platform. Compared to other alternative JVM languages, Groovy has the advantage of offering the best interoperability story with Java, while still keeping a concise syntax familiar to Java developers.\nWhat about the mobile story? In particular, with Android, developers basically only hava Java as sole choice.\nCouldn’t they too benefit from advantages provided by Groovy?\nCan’t we make Android developers life less painful too?\nIn this session, Guillaume will show how you can use Groovy to develop Android applications, bringing all the productivity and modernity Groovy provides on the Android platform.\nHe will also explain the potential issues you might be encountering, but if you are jealous of your iOS friends with Swift, get your smile back, Groovy is there for you!",

I’ll do this by looking at the full life cycle of a release, going from how we organize our source, do code reviews in phabricator, through building using tools such as Buck, to how we’ve improved the quality of our releases using OSS testing tools such as Selendroid.",
